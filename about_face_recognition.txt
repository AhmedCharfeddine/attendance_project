1/ IMPORTING THE IMAGE: (as numpy array)

img = fr.load_image_file("path-to-image")

2/ CONVERTING IT TO RGB:

img = cv2.cvtColor(imgperson, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

3/ GETTING A LIST CONTAINING THE COORDINATES OF THE RECTANGLE AROUND A FACE: (top, right, bottom, left)

face_location = fr.face_locations(img)[0]

# face_locations returns a list of rectangles around all faces detected. Hence the indexing [0]


4/ GETTING THE ENCODING:

face_encoding = fr.face_encodings(img)[0]

# face_encoding is a 128-dimensional numpy array.
"""
    For face recognition, the algorithm notes certain important measurements on
    the face — like the color and size and slant of eyes, the gap between
    eyebrows, etc. All these put together define the face encoding — the
    information obtained out of the image — that is used to identify the
    particular face.
